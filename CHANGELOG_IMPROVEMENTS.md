# AFK GitHub Template Improvements

**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Version**: 2.0 (Major improvements based on real-world usage feedback)

## Summary

This document summarizes all improvements made to the AFK GitHub template based on feedback from actual usage in a new project. These changes address shell compatibility issues, outdated CLI syntax, and general setup pain points.

---

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Shell Compatibility (High Priority) ✅

**Problem**: Commands used bash-specific syntax but macOS defaults to zsh, causing parse errors.

**Impact**: Users saw `(eval):1: parse error near ')'` when running commands directly in zsh.

**Solution**:
- Wrapped all multi-line bash commands in heredoc blocks: `bash << 'EOFSCRIPT' ... EOFSCRIPT`
- Replaced `source .env` with portable `grep/cut` extraction: `PORT=$(grep "^PORT=" .env | cut -d'=' -f2)`
- Added clear prerequisites warning about shell compatibility in setup guide

**Files Fixed**:
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/detect_next_port.md`
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/start_tailscale_funnel.md`
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/test_afk_github.md`
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/setup_github_webhook.md`
- `scripts/start_tailscale_funnel.sh`

### 2. Tailscale CLI Version Mismatch (High Priority) ✅

**Problem**: Old command syntax `tailscale funnel $PORT &` doesn't work with Tailscale v1.88+.

**Impact**: Users got error: `"the CLI for serve and funnel has changed"`

**Solution**:
- Updated to new CLI syntax: `tailscale funnel --bg $PORT`
- Added fallback for older versions
- Added version check and display in scripts
- Added Tailscale version requirement (v1.88+) to prerequisites

**Files Fixed**:
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/start_tailscale_funnel.md`
- `scripts/start_tailscale_funnel.sh`

### 3. Case-Sensitive Process Matching (Medium Priority) ✅

**Problem**: `grep -q Python` failed when process name was `python3.1`.

**Impact**: Test scripts incorrectly reported server as not running.

**Solution**: Changed to case-insensitive grep: `grep -iq python`

**Files Fixed**:
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/test_afk_github.md`

### 4. Bash Regex Portability (Medium Priority) ✅

**Problem**: Bash regex `[[ $VAR =~ pattern ]]` doesn't work reliably across different shell versions.

**Impact**: GitHub URL parsing failed silently in some environments.

**Solution**: Replaced bash regex with portable `sed/cut` pipelines:
```bash
# Old (bash-specific):
if [[ $GITHUB_REPO_URL =~ github\.com[:/]([^/]+)/([^/.]+) ]]; then
    OWNER="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
    REPO="${BASH_REMATCH[2]}"
fi

# New (portable):
OWNER=$(echo "$GITHUB_REPO_URL" | sed 's|.*github.com[:/]||' | cut -d'/' -f1)
REPO=$(echo "$GITHUB_REPO_URL" | sed 's|.*github.com[:/]||' | cut -d'/' -f2 | sed 's|\.git$||')
```

**Files Fixed**:
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/test_afk_github.md`
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/setup_github_webhook.md`

---

## New Features Added

### 1. All-in-One Setup Script ✅

**Created**: `scripts/setup_afk_github_full.sh`

A comprehensive, single-command setup script that:
- ✅ Checks all prerequisites (gh, tailscale, claude, uv, jq)
- ✅ Detects available port automatically
- ✅ Configures GitHub repository
- ✅ Sets up environment variables
- ✅ Starts Tailscale funnel
- ✅ Creates GitHub webhook
- ✅ Starts webhook server
- ✅ Provides colored, step-by-step output
- ✅ Verifies each step before proceeding
- ✅ Displays comprehensive final summary

**Usage**:
```bash
bash scripts/setup_afk_github_full.sh
```

### 2. Reset Script ✅

**Created**: `scripts/reset_afk_github.sh`

A utility script to cleanly reset the AFK GitHub setup:
- Stops webhook server
- Stops Tailscale funnel
- Optionally clears logs
- Provides clear next steps

**Usage**:
```bash
bash scripts/reset_afk_github.sh
```

### 3. Enhanced Prerequisites Section ✅

**Added to**: `AFK_GITHUB_SETUP.md`

New comprehensive prerequisites section covering:
- Required tools with installation commands
- Shell compatibility warning and workarounds
- Tailscale version check instructions
- Clear explanation of why prerequisites matter

### 4. Verification Steps Between Phases ✅

**Added to**: `AFK_GITHUB_SETUP.md`

Added verification commands after each setup phase:
- Verify files copied correctly
- Verify dependencies installed
- Verify port configured
- Verify funnel running
- Verify server running
- Verify webhook created

Example:
```bash
# After port detection
grep "^PORT=" .env && echo "✅ Port configured" || echo "❌ Port not set"
```

### 5. Comprehensive Troubleshooting Section ✅

**Enhanced in**: `AFK_GITHUB_SETUP.md`

Added detailed troubleshooting for all common issues:
- Parse errors in zsh (with solution)
- Tailscale funnel command failures (with version update instructions)
- Webhook not receiving events (with diagnostic commands)
- Port already in use (with port detection steps)
- Process matching failures (explained the case-sensitivity fix)
- ADW not processing issues (with verification commands)
- Environment variable loading issues (with portable extraction)
- Funnel persistence problems (with --bg flag explanation)

Each issue includes:
- **Root cause** explanation
- **Solution** with exact commands
- **Verification** steps

## Documentation Improvements

### 1. Updated Quick Start Section

Changed from single-path setup to dual-path approach:

**Method 1**: Fully automated with `setup_afk_github_full.sh` (recommended)
**Method 2**: Claude Code guided setup (for troubleshooting)

### 2. Better Error Messages

All scripts now provide:
- Clear error messages with ❌ prefix
- Exact commands to fix the issue
- Context about what went wrong
- Next steps to continue

Example:
```bash
if [ -z "$PORT" ]; then
    echo "❌ PORT not set in .env"
    echo ""
    echo "Run this first:"
    echo "  Read and execute .claude/commands/afk_github/detect_next_port.md"
    exit 1
fi
```

### 3. Version History

Added version tracking to `AFK_GITHUB_SETUP.md`:
- v1.0 (2025-01-26): Initial release
- v2.0 (2025-01-27): Major improvements based on user feedback

## Testing Recommendations

Before releasing these changes, test the following scenarios:

### On macOS with zsh (default)
1. Run `setup_afk_github_full.sh` from scratch
2. Verify all commands work without switching to bash
3. Test reset and re-run setup

### On macOS with bash
1. Run `setup_afk_github_full.sh` from scratch
2. Verify backward compatibility

### With Old Tailscale Version
1. Test with Tailscale < v1.88
2. Verify fallback syntax works

### With New Tailscale Version
1. Test with Tailscale v1.88+
2. Verify --bg flag works

### Edge Cases
1. Port already in use → Should find next available
2. Missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY → Should fail with clear message
3. Tailscale not running → Should fail with clear instructions
4. GitHub remote not set → Should fail with setup instructions

## Migration Guide (For Existing Users)

If you already have AFK GitHub set up with the old template:

1. **Pull the latest changes**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/afk-github-template
   git pull
   ```

2. **Copy updated files to your project**:
   ```bash
   # Update command files
   cp -r .claude/commands/afk_github /path/to/your-project/.claude/commands/

   # Update scripts
   cp scripts/start_tailscale_funnel.sh /path/to/your-project/scripts/
   cp scripts/setup_afk_github_full.sh /path/to/your-project/scripts/
   cp scripts/reset_afk_github.sh /path/to/your-project/scripts/
   chmod +x /path/to/your-project/scripts/*.sh

   # Update setup guide
   cp AFK_GITHUB_SETUP.md /path/to/your-project/
   ```

3. **No need to re-run setup** if already working - these are improvements for new setups

4. **Optional: Test the improvements**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your-project
   bash scripts/test_afk_github.sh
   ```
