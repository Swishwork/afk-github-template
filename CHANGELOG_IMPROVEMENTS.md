## Version 2.1 - Mobile UX & Critical Bugfix (2025-01-27)

### Critical Bugfix: State Preservation

**Problem**: Webhook was destroying state data from previous workflow phases!

**Root Cause**: When `adw_build` was triggered with an auto-detected or explicit ADW ID, the webhook would:
1. Load existing state (containing `branch_name`, `plan_file`, `issue_class` from planning phase)
2. Call `state.update()` with ONLY `adw_id` and `issue_number`
3. Save the incomplete state, **overwriting** all the planning data
4. Result: Build phase fails with "No branch name in state"

**Example Failure Scenario**:
```
3:53 PM - Planning completes, saves full state ‚úÖ
4:21 PM - User posts "adw_build"
4:21 PM - Webhook auto-detects ID, loads state
4:21 PM - Webhook OVERWRITES state with partial data ‚ùå
4:21 PM - Build starts, finds empty state ‚ùå
         Error: "No branch name in state - run adw_plan.py first"
```

**Fix**: Check if state already has `branch_name` before saving:
```python
if provided_adw_id:
    state = ADWState(provided_adw_id)

    # Only save if this is a NEW workflow (no branch_name yet)
    # If branch_name exists, preserve the existing state!
    if not state.data.get("branch_name"):
        state.update(adw_id=provided_adw_id, issue_number=str(issue_number))
        state.save("webhook_trigger")
    else:
        # Existing state - don't touch it!
        print(f"Preserving existing state (branch: {state.data.get('branch_name')})")
```

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ `adw_build` now works correctly after `adw_plan`
- ‚úÖ Multi-phase workflows preserve state
- ‚úÖ Prevents "No branch name" errors
- ‚úÖ Logged for debugging

---

### Auto-Detection of ADW IDs

**Problem**: When continuing work with `adw_build`, users had to manually copy/paste UUID from previous comments. On mobile devices, this is extremely difficult.

**Solution**: Automatic detection of ADW IDs from issue history!

#### Implementation Details

**New Function**: `find_latest_adw_id_in_issue(issue_number)` in `trigger_webhook.py`

Searches issue comments in reverse chronological order for ADW IDs using three robust patterns:
1. **JSON state dumps**: `"adw_id": "75de9bea-..."`
2. **Explicit mentions**: `adw_id: 75de9bea-...`
3. **Comment prefixes**: `75de9bea-..._sdlc_planner:`

#### User Experience

**Before**:
```
User: adw_build
Bot: ‚ùå Error: Missing ADW ID
User: *scrolls through comments on mobile*
User: *tries to copy UUID from comment*
User: *gives up and uses desktop*
```

**After**:
```
User: adw_build
Bot: üí° Auto-detected ADW ID: 75de9bea-b0f3-4450-b093-3b009bc66238
     Proceeding with adw_build...
     ‚úÖ [starts building]
```

#### Error Messages

When auto-detection fails (no previous plan found), users get helpful guidance:

```markdown
‚ùå Missing ADW ID

`adw_build` requires an ADW ID to know which plan to continue from.

**Usage:**
- `adw_build <adw_id>` (e.g., `adw_build 75de9bea`)
- Or: `adw_build: description` with `adw_id: <adw_id>` on a separate line

**Finding the ADW ID:**
Look for the "Final planning state" comment from the planning phase,
or any comment with `adw_id: ...` in it.

**Alternative:**
Use `adw_plan_build` instead - it creates a new plan and builds it automatically!
```

#### Benefits

1. **Mobile-First**: No more copying UUIDs on mobile devices
2. **Educational**: Error messages teach proper syntax
3. **Transparent**: Bot explains when auto-detection is used
4. **Backward Compatible**: Explicit IDs still work
5. **Smart**: Finds the LATEST plan, not old ones

#### Files Modified

- `adws/adw_triggers/trigger_webhook.py`:
  - Added `import re`
  - Added imports: `fetch_issue_comments`, `extract_repo_path`
  - Added function: `find_latest_adw_id_in_issue()` (~60 lines)
  - Enhanced validation logic with auto-detection (~40 lines)

## Version 2.0 - Critical Fixes Implemented (2025-01-27)

### 1. Shell Compatibility (High Priority) ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Commands used bash-specific syntax but macOS defaults to zsh, causing parse errors.

**Impact**: Users saw `(eval):1: parse error near ')'` when running commands directly in zsh.

**Solution**:
- Wrapped all multi-line bash commands in heredoc blocks: `bash << 'EOFSCRIPT' ... EOFSCRIPT`
- Replaced `source .env` with portable `grep/cut` extraction: `PORT=$(grep "^PORT=" .env | cut -d'=' -f2)`
- Added clear prerequisites warning about shell compatibility in setup guide

**Files Fixed**:
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/detect_next_port.md`
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/start_tailscale_funnel.md`
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/test_afk_github.md`
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/setup_github_webhook.md`
- `scripts/start_tailscale_funnel.sh`

### 2. Tailscale CLI Version Mismatch (High Priority) ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Old command syntax `tailscale funnel $PORT &` doesn't work with Tailscale v1.88+.

**Impact**: Users got error: `"the CLI for serve and funnel has changed"`

**Solution**:
- Updated to new CLI syntax: `tailscale funnel --bg $PORT`
- Added fallback for older versions
- Added version check and display in scripts
- Added Tailscale version requirement (v1.88+) to prerequisites

**Files Fixed**:
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/start_tailscale_funnel.md`
- `scripts/start_tailscale_funnel.sh`

### 3. Case-Sensitive Process Matching (Medium Priority) ‚úÖ

**Problem**: `grep -q Python` failed when process name was `python3.1`.

**Impact**: Test scripts incorrectly reported server as not running.

**Solution**: Changed to case-insensitive grep: `grep -iq python`

**Files Fixed**:
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/test_afk_github.md`

### 4. Bash Regex Portability (Medium Priority) ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Bash regex `[[ $VAR =~ pattern ]]` doesn't work reliably across different shell versions.

**Impact**: GitHub URL parsing failed silently in some environments.

**Solution**: Replaced bash regex with portable `sed/cut` pipelines:
```bash
# Old (bash-specific):
if [[ $GITHUB_REPO_URL =~ github\.com[:/]([^/]+)/([^/.]+) ]]; then
    OWNER="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
    REPO="${BASH_REMATCH[2]}"
fi

# New (portable):
OWNER=$(echo "$GITHUB_REPO_URL" | sed 's|.*github.com[:/]||' | cut -d'/' -f1)
REPO=$(echo "$GITHUB_REPO_URL" | sed 's|.*github.com[:/]||' | cut -d'/' -f2 | sed 's|\.git$||')
```

**Files Fixed**:
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/test_afk_github.md`
- `.claude/commands/afk_github/setup_github_webhook.md`

---

Example:
```bash
# After port detection
grep "^PORT=" .env && echo "‚úÖ Port configured" || echo "‚ùå Port not set"
```

**Enhanced in**: `AFK_GITHUB_SETUP.md`

Added detailed troubleshooting for all common issues:
- Parse errors in zsh (with solution)
- Tailscale funnel command failures (with version update instructions)

## Documentation Improvements

### 1. Updated Quick Start Section

Changed from single-path setup to dual-path approach:

**Method 1**: Fully automated with `setup_afk_github_full.sh` (recommended)

- Context about what went wrong
- Next steps to continue

Example:
```bash
if [ -z "$PORT" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå PORT not set in .env"
    echo ""
    echo "Run this first:"
    echo "  Read and execute .claude/commands/afk_github/detect_next_port.md"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Testing Recommendations

Before releasing these changes, test the following scenarios:

### On macOS with zsh (default)
1. Run `setup_afk_github_full.sh` from scratch
2. Verify all commands work without switching to bash
3. Test reset and re-run setup

### On macOS with bash
1. Run `setup_afk_github_full.sh` from scratch
2. Verify backward compatibility

### With Old Tailscale Version
1. Test with Tailscale < v1.88
2. Verify fallback syntax works

### With New Tailscale Version
1. Test with Tailscale v1.88+
2. Verify --bg flag works

### Edge Cases
1. Port already in use ‚Üí Should find next available
2. Missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY ‚Üí Should fail with clear message
3. Tailscale not running ‚Üí Should fail with clear instructions
4. GitHub remote not set ‚Üí Should fail with setup instructions

## Migration Guide (For Existing Users)

If you already have AFK GitHub set up with the old template:

1. **Pull the latest changes**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/afk-github-template
   git pull
   ```

2. **Copy updated files to your project**:
   ```bash
   # Update command files
   cp -r .claude/commands/afk_github /path/to/your-project/.claude/commands/

   # Update scripts
   cp scripts/start_tailscale_funnel.sh /path/to/your-project/scripts/
   cp scripts/setup_afk_github_full.sh /path/to/your-project/scripts/
   cp scripts/reset_afk_github.sh /path/to/your-project/scripts/
   chmod +x /path/to/your-project/scripts/*.sh

   # Update setup guide
   cp AFK_GITHUB_SETUP.md /path/to/your-project/
   ```

3. **No need to re-run setup** if already working - these are improvements for new setups

4. **Optional: Test the improvements**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your-project
   bash scripts/test_afk_github.sh
   ```
